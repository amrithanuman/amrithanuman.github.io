                <p>Looking back, I've always enjoyed visual arts. I would draw, paint, design themes for my friends' now outdated mobile phones or online profile pages, as well as edit photos and videos of my favorite TV show characters. These were considered my hobbies and were not well developed skills. Growing up, my goal was to become an engineer, so my focus was there. It was during my degree that I found my love of programming in none other than the field of image processing. Still very technical, I had a desire to get back to my more creative passions. I think for technical minds that would like to express their creative side, a career in web development is an excellent path to follow. For this reason, I began self-study of web development technologies. I am going to enjoy this!</p>
